=================

  * The *60_Keyboard_case.stl* file is the one I used to test the dimensions and mounting holes for the board. I found it at [this link](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:983332), accessed at 15/03/19. It was developed by user ziptyze and the page contains pictures of the prototyped case.
